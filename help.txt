<color:0000ff>================
<color:00ffff>Welcome to TheBlackParrot's Take(placeholder)!
<color:ffffff>This is under heavy development, so bugs and weird things are bound to occur. Please report them immediately if you come across any.
<a:github.com/TheBlackParrot/blockland-brickochet>GitHub Repository</a> \c7|| <a:github.com/TheBlackParrot/blockland-brickochet/issues>Issues/To-do List</a>
<color:ff00ff>==-- GAMEMODE INFO --==
<color:ff00bb>-- YOUR GOAL --
<color:ffffff>You want your lasers to hit as many bricks as possible within 10 minute rounds. The winner is decided by who "owns" the most bricks after the round is over.
<color:ffffff>You ARE ALLOWED to steal bricks from other players.
<color:ff00bb>-- CONTROL INFO --
<color:ffffff>You can jump an infinite amount of times in the air, <color:ffffbb>as long as you're inside a brick.<color:ffffff> Try clicking over and over to gain some air!
<color:ffffff>Jets are on if you need to prevent gravity, they're practically useless here otherwise.
<color:ffffff>Lasers will last for 30 seconds (due to TGE limitations), or until it hits an edge (except the bottom) of the playing area.
<color:ff00bb>-- SAVING/LOADING --
<color:ffffff>Both saving and loading is automatic. Every time your laser explodes, your game saves. Crashes + data loss is a thing of the past.
<color:ffffff>Your game loads when you enter the server, and it would be pointless to re-load your data manually due to the way it saves.
<color:ffffff>Your data is fine, trust me.
